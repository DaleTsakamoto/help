    <meta name="description" property="og:description" content="help was created during the 2020 pandemic as a way to connect people who need help(helpees) with those who can help them out (helpers). The app was designed especially for older people who may be limited in where they can go during the pandemic because of the risk of catching Covid-19. Helpers can connect with local helpees in the area by searching their area or waiting for the page to dynamically load and display below on the homepage. Each user can access the tasks they need to complete as helpers or can add a task to a list for helpees. Tasks range from doing house chores to picking up groceries." />
